NAME
    Nagios::Scrape - Scrapes and Parses the status.cgi page of a Nagios
    installation

VERSION
    Version 0.02

SYNOPSIS
    This module uses LWP to retrieve the status.cgi page of a Nagios
    installation, parses the data into a manageable format, and then makes
    it accessible.

    This is a more lightweight solution to Nagios installations where the
    status.dat file can reach 1+mb in size.

        use Nagios::Scrape;

        my $foo = Nagios::Scrape->new(username => $username, password => $password, url => $url);
        @service_alerts = $foo->get_service_status();
        @host_alerts = $foo->get_host_status();

SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
    Creates a new class given a username and password.

        my $nagios = Nagios::Scrape->new(username => $username, password => $password, url => $url);

  host_state
    This method allows you to filter certain host states. The table is as
    follows:

    Hosts: 
    PENDING         1 
    UP              2 
    DOWN            4 
    UNREACHABLE     8

    Add the number for each state that you want to see. For example, to see
    DOWN and UNREACHABLE states, set this value to 12. (Default value).

  service_state
    This method allows you to filter certain service states. The table is as
    follows:

    Services: 
    PENDING         1 
    OK              2 
    WARNING         4 
    UNKNOWN         8
    CRITICAL 16

    Add the number for each state you would like to see. For example, to see
    WARNING, UNKNOWN, and CRITICAL states, set the number to 28. (Default
    value).

  get_service_status
    Connects to given URL and retrieves the requested service statuses

  get_host_status
    Connects to given url and retrieves host statuses

  parse_service_content
